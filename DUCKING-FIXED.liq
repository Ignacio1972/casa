I don't have formal documentation for this transaction as it was handled as an informal arrangement.

## Subject: Response to Request for Information - [Reference Number]

Dear Binance Compliance Team,

I am writing in response to your Request for Information regarding a recent transaction from my account.

Similar to my previous RFI response regarding a $300 BTC deposit, this transaction was related to my digital production consulting work through my company (https://lobo-media.com/). The payment was sent to an individual I connected with through social media platforms for consulting services.

### Documentation Limitations

I must honestly acknowledge that I do not have comprehensive documentation for this transaction:

- **No formal contract:** This was an informal arrangement, as is common in my freelance consulting work
- **Limited communication records:** The original conversations took place through private messaging platforms where messages are no longer available
- **No invoices:** Given the informal nature, no formal invoicing was processed

While I lack formal documentation, I can provide the following information:

1. **Business Context:** Details about my legitimate production company and consulting services
2. **General Nature of Work:** The type of digital production consulting I typically provide
3. **Transaction Pattern:** This follows a similar pattern to the previously reported $300 transaction
4. **Recipient Information:** [Any basic information you actually know about the recipient - location, general nature of their business, etc.]

### Lessons Learned and Future Compliance

Following my previous RFI experience, I recognize the importance of maintaining better records. However, I acknowledge that I had not yet fully implemented improved documentation practices at the time of this transaction.

Moving forward, I commit to:
- Maintaining written agreements for all transactions
- Keeping comprehensive communication records
- Implementing proper invoicing procedures
- Conducting enhanced due diligence on all recipients

### Cooperation with Investigation

I understand that the lack of documentation may complicate your review process. I am fully committed to:

Dear Binance Compliance Team,

Thank you for reaching out.

I understand your concerns regarding the recent transaction. I would like to clarify that the funds sent to the recipient address were my own and originated from legitimate sources within my Binance account.

At the time of the transfer, I had no knowledge or indication that the recipient might be involved in suspicious or illicit activity. This was a personal transaction made in good faith, and I was unaware of any potential risk or blacklisted status associated with their wallet.

I do not engage in the use of mixers, DEXes, or unverified wallets with the intent to obscure transactions, nor do I support any illegal financial behavior.

I am fully committed to complying with Binance’s policies and local regulations and am available to provide any further details you may need.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

quiero que te fijes en los cards que hay en el modulo campaigns. En cada card hay una fila con 5 iconos. Preview, edit,programacion, enviar a la radio, eliminar.

Me gustaria utilizar exactamente el mismo estilo, misma estetoca y mismos iconos para el dashboard, especificamente en la seccion "Generador de mensajes". Una vez que se genera el mensaje siempre se despliega el reproductor del preview y abajo del reproductor aparece el boton "guardar en biblioteca"
